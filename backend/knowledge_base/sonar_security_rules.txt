SonarSource Security Rules Database
=====================================

URL: https://rules.sonarsource.com/

Description:
SonarSource provides comprehensive security vulnerability detection rules for multiple programming languages including:

Languages Covered:
- Java
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- C/C++
- C#
- PHP
- Go
- Kotlin
- Swift
- Ruby
- Scala
- HTML
- CSS
- XML
- YAML
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- CloudFormation
- And many more...

Key Features:
1. **Vulnerability Detection**: Covers OWASP Top 10, CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration), and SANS Top 25
2. **Code Quality**: Detects bugs, code smells, and maintainability issues
3. **Security Hotspots**: Identifies security-sensitive code that needs manual review
4. **Multi-language Support**: Comprehensive coverage across major programming languages
5. **Regular Updates**: Continuously updated with new vulnerability patterns

Categories of Security Rules:
- **Injection Flaws**: SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection
- **Authentication & Session Management**: Weak authentication, session fixation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, DOM-based XSS
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- **Security Misconfigurations**: Default passwords, debug mode enabled
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Hardcoded credentials, unencrypted data
- **Access Control Issues**: Privilege escalation, path traversal
- **Cryptographic Issues**: Weak encryption, improper key management
- **Input Validation**: Buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities
- **Error Handling**: Information disclosure through error messages

Usage in Security Analysis:
This resource should be integrated into automated security scanning tools and used as a reference for:
- Static code analysis rule development
- Security code review checklists
- Vulnerability assessment methodologies
- Developer training on secure coding practices

Integration Recommendations:
1. Use SonarQube/SonarCloud for automated scanning
2. Reference specific rule IDs in security reports
3. Map findings to CWE/CVE identifiers for standardization
4. Include in CI/CD pipelines for continuous security assessment
