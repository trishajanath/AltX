/**
 * ðŸ”¬ Expert Code Review: TaskItem Component
 * This component encapsulates the display and interaction logic for a single task.
 * 1.  **Event Handling Security**: The `onClick` handlers for toggling and deleting do not contain business logic themselves. They simply call the prop functions (`onToggleComplete(task.id)`). This is a secure pattern as it ensures the component cannot perform actions it's not authorized to. The actual logic resides in the parent `App` component.
 * 2.  **Conditional Rendering and Styling**: The use of conditional classes (`task.completed ? '...' : '...'`) for styling provides immediate visual feedback. This is a secure way to reflect state, as it relies solely on the `task.completed` prop and doesn't involve manipulating the DOM directly, which could open XSS vulnerabilities if done improperly with user-generated content.
 * 3.  **Component Granularity**: By breaking down the UI into small, single-responsibility components like `TaskItem`, the codebase becomes easier to audit for security flaws and to maintain. Each component has a clearly defined and limited scope.
 *
 * @param {{ task: {id: number | string, text: string, completed: boolean}, onDeleteTask: (id: number | string) => void, onToggleComplete: (id: number | string) => void }} props
