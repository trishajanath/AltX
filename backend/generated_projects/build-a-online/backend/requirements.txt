# Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
fastapi-cors==1.0.1
# Note: Newer FastAPI versions have this built-in, but this explicit package can be used.
# Let's stick to the built-in middleware for simplicity and robustness. The correct dependency is fastapi itself.
# The following is just for reference, the main.py will use FastAPI's own middleware.
# python-cors is a common name, but the one for FastAPI is usually installed with it.

# No specific package needed, it's in the Python standard library.
