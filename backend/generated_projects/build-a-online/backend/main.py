# 
üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Security Analysis:
# This setup includes key security best practices:
# 1.  CORS Configuration: Strict origin whitelisting prevents unauthorized domains from making requests.
#     Using '*' for origins is a major security risk (CSRF) and is avoided here.
# 2.  Centralized Routing: Using an APIRouter helps in organizing the code and applying middleware/dependencies cleanly.
# 3.  Pydantic Validation: All incoming data is rigorously validated against the Pydantic models in `models.py`.
#     This is the first line of defense against injection attacks, data type mismatches, and malformed payloads.
# 4.  Custom Exception Handling: Provides a consistent, non-revealing error format to clients,
#     avoiding leakage of internal application states or stack traces.
# 5.  Health Check Endpoint: Essential for production monitoring, load balancers, and container orchestrators (like Kubernetes).

#  FastAPI Application Initialization 
app = FastAPI(
    title=settings.PROJECT_NAME,

    docs_url=f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/docs",
    redoc_url=f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/redoc",
)

#  CORS Middleware Configuration 
# This is a critical security feature for frontend integrations.
# It allows the React frontend (running on localhost:5173) to access the API.
# In production, you would replace the localhost origin with your actual frontend domain.

# This ensures that API validation errors are returned in a clean, consistent JSON format.

# Useful for initializing resources like database connections.
